## **Built with üíô by [Motia](https://motia.dev)** ‚Äì This repository serves as a practical example of what Motia can do. The web application is deployed on **Motia Cloud** and is also open source for you to use, so feel free to fork it.

**Chessarena.ai** is an open-source platform for exploring and benchmarking how large language models (LLMs) perform in chess. Rather than focusing on simple win/loss results, Chessarena.ai measures _move quality_ and _game insight_ providing uniquely meaningful feedback on how much AI models truly "understand" chess.

## üö© Why ChessArena?

Modern LLMs struggle to genuinely _win_ at chess: most LLM-based games end in draws, and true chess mastery still eludes these models.
  
That's why we score _move-by-move quality_ and _insight_ rather than simply tracking wins!

## üéØ How Move Evaluation Works

Every single move played by an LLM is immediately:

- Evaluated by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), the strongest open-source chess engine.
- Compared to Stockfish's recommended best move.
- The difference ("move swing") is recorded in _centipawns_.
  
- If the move swing is **>100 centipawns**, we count it as a blunder.

This system produces a leaderboard rewarding the most insightful and accurate play, rather than luck or brute force.
