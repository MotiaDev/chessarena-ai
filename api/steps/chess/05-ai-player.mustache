## Current Position
- FEN: `{{fen}}`.
{{#inCheck}}- WARNING: You are in check! You MUST get out of check.{{/inCheck}}

## YOUR ONLY VALID MOVES
CRITICAL: You can ONLY use moves from this list. ANY other move will be rejected as illegal.
{{#totalMoves}}You have {{totalMoves}} legal moves—evaluate them carefully and choose the strongest one.{{/totalMoves}}
This is a list of moves in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).

{{#validMoves}}
- {{san}}
{{/validMoves}}

{{#lastInvalidMove}}
❌ ILLEGAL MOVE: {{lastInvalidMove}} was REJECTED because it's not in the list above.
INSTRUCTION: SELECT a move that EXISTS in the list above. Do not invent moves.
{{/lastInvalidMove}}

⚠️ Three illegal moves end the match instantly.

## Required Response Format

Your response must be valid JSON with exactly two fields:
{
  "thought": "Your strategic reasoning (1-2 sentences)",
  "moveSan": "EXACT_MOVE_FROM_LIST_ABOVE"
}

**Steps to follow:**
1. Review the valid moves list above
2. Evaluate candidate moves strategically (see guidelines below)
3. Select the strongest move from the list
4. Copy its value EXACTLY into the "moveSan" field
5. Respond ONLY with the JSON—no additional text

**Example responses** (only valid if these moves are in your legal moves list):
```json
{
  "thought": "Capturing the knight wins material while maintaining king safety",
  "moveSan": "Na3"
}
```

**Incorrect example (DO NOT DO THIS):**
```json
{
  "thought": "I'll invent my own move",
  "moveSan": "Na6"
}
```
❌ This is wrong because "Na6" is not in the valid moves list above.

## Strategy Guidelines
When evaluating moves, consider:
- **Tactical motifs**: Recognize forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks, and other tactical patterns
- **Position assessment**:
  - Material balance
  - King safety
  - Pawn structure
  - Piece activity and coordination
  - Weaknesses (backward pawns, weak squares, isolated pawns)
- **Candidate move comparison**: Visualize resulting positions for multiple moves—don't settle for the first good-looking option
- **Long-term planning**: Build plans to win the game, not just reactive moves
  - Improve your worst-placed piece
  - Control key files and diagonals
  - Create favorable imbalances
  - Transition to winning endgames
- **Safety checks**: Ensure your move doesn't expose your pieces to capture unless you gain a tactical advantage

## Critical Rules
1. Your "moveSan" value MUST be copied exactly from the legal moves list—character-for-character
2. Your response must be ONLY valid JSON with "thought" and "moveSan" fields
3. Double-check your chosen move exists in the legal moves list before responding
4. Any move not in the list will be rejected and count toward your three-strike limit
