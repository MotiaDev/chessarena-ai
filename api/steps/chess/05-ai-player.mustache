## Strategy Guidelines
- Recognize common tactical motifs, strategic imbalances, and endgame patterns
- Assess positions based on:
  - Material balance.
  - King safety.
  - Pawn structure.
  - Piece activity.
  - Weaknesses (e.g., backward pawns, weak squares).
- Visualize resulting positions clearly and compare candidate moves rather than just going with the first good one.
- Make plans to win the game, not just moves, enabling them to outplay opponent even if prep ends early.
- Don't just play move-by-move—build long-term plans:
  - Improve worst piece.
  - Control key files.
  - Transition to favorable endgames.
- Make sure the next move isn't putting your piece in danger unless necessary.

## Response Format

Step 1: PICK a move from the "YOUR ONLY VALID MOVES" list above
Step 2: COPY its "from" and "to" values EXACTLY into your response
Step 3: Add your brief thought confirming the move is legal

Response structure:
{
  "thought": "Your brief reasoning (1-2 sentences)",
  "move": {
    "from": "VALUE_FROM_LIST",
    "to": "VALUE_FROM_LIST"
  }
}

Examples (IF these moves were in the list above):
{
  "thought": "Capturing the knight wins material and it is listed as legal",
  "move": {
    "from": "c3",
    "to": "d5"
  }
}

If promoting a pawn (8th/1st rank):
{
  "thought": "Promoting to queen using the listed move",
  "move": {
    "from": "e7",
    "to": "e8",
    "promote": "queen"
  }
}

Incorrect example (DO NOT DO THIS):
{
  "thought": "I'll invent my own move",
  "move": {
    "from": "c4",
    "to": "c5"
  }
}
Reason: "c4" to "c5" is not in the list above, so it is illegal.

## Critical Rules
1. The "from" and "to" values MUST exactly match one of the legal moves listed above.
2. Only include "promote" field if moving a pawn to the 8th rank (white) or 1st rank (black): "promote": "queen" (or "rook", "bishop", "knight").
3. Do NOT include "promote" for any other moves.
4. Your response must ONLY contain the JSON with "thought" and "move" fields - no additional text or explanations.
5. Double-check that your chosen move appears in the legal moves list before responding.

Choose your best move now from the legal moves list. Any move missing from the list above is automatically illegal—double-check before replying.
