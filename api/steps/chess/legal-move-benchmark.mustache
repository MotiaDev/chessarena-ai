You are a chess expert. Given the following game, list ALL legal moves available for the current player.

## Game (PGN)
{{pgn}}

## Current Position
It is {{turn}}'s turn to move.
FEN: {{fen}}

## Task
List ALL legal moves for {{turn}} in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).

## Response Format
Return ONLY a JSON object with no additional text:
{
  "moves": ["move1", "move2", "move3", ...]
}

## CRITICAL - Use Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN):
CORRECT format examples: Nf3, e4, O-O, Bxc6, Qd7, Rfe1, exd5, h4
WRONG format (do NOT use): Ng1f3, e2e4, Bf1c4, Ke1g1

Rules:
- Pawns: just the destination square (e4) or capture (exd5)
- Pieces: piece letter + destination (Nf3, Bc4, Qd1)
- Captures: add 'x' (Bxc6, Nxe5, exd5)
- Castling: O-O (kingside) or O-O-O (queenside)
- Do NOT include starting square (Ng1f3 is WRONG, Nf3 is CORRECT)
- Include ALL legal moves, not just good moves
